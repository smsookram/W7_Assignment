✍️ Reflection 

I approached this problem by first ensuring I understood what it was asking for and 
the even number rule it proposed. I made sure that the constraints would be implemented into 
my solution. I also considered what was needed to verify edge cases, like the number two, since
although two is even it is not divisible into two even integers. I wanted to make sure I used
clear logic and tested all examples given. I also wanted to make sure tests would catch any invalid 
entries or bugs.
